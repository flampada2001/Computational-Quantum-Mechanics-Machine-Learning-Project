## Computational Quantum Mechanics Project 2023-2024
This repository is split in two parts.

The first one named RHF contains the python files that were created for the computational quantum mechanics class project. The information profile of each atom with $2 \leq Z \leq 10$ was studied using the Shannon information entropy.

The second one named Machine_Learning contains the jupyter notebook file that was created for the computational machine learning class project. Classifiers were created such that we could classify events in coliders as background noise or signals that could lead to the discovery of new particles.
